### Hi, my name is Vladislavs.


**From Professional Athlete to Developer**

I've always been passionate about pushing my limits, and my journey as a professional athlete has played a significant role in shaping who I am today. Over the years, I've had the privilege of competing at the highest level in my sport, dedicating myself to continuous improvement, discipline, and commitment to my goals.

**Lessons from the Football**

The football taught me the value of determination, resilience, and teamwork. Whether it was on the field, in meetings, or in the study room, I discovered that success is not just about talent, but about the continuous pursuit of excellence, the ability to adapt to challenges, and the importance of a strong support system.

**Endless Curiosity**

Just as I once fine-tuned my skills on the field, I now channel my energy into honing my coding skills and tackling complex problems. I'm driven by a boundless curiosity that fuels my desire to keep learning and exploring the ever-evolving world of technology.
