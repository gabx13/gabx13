### Hi there 👋 my name is Vladislavs.


🏆 **Professional Athlete Turned Developer**

I've always been passionate about pushing my limits, and my journey as a professional athlete has played a significant role in shaping who I am today. Over the years, I've had the privilege of competing at the highest level in my sport, dedicating myself to continuous improvement, discipline, and unwavering commitment to my goals.

🧠 **Lessons from the Football**

The football taught me the value of determination, resilience, and teamwork. Whether it was on the field, in meetings, or in the study room, I discovered that success is not just about talent, but about the relentless pursuit of excellence, the ability to adapt to challenges, and the importance of a strong support system.

📚 **Current Journey at 42 Wolfsburg Coding School**

Today, I'm taking my passion for challenges and excellence to the world of coding. I'm currently studying at 42 Wolfsburg coding school, where I'm diving deep into the fascinating world of software development. The same dedication that fueled my athletic career now drives my pursuit of coding mastery.

🌟 **Endless Curiosity**

Just as I once fine-tuned my skills on the field, I now channel my energy into honing my coding skills and tackling complex problems. I'm driven by a boundless curiosity that fuels my desire to keep learning and exploring the ever-evolving world of technology.

🤝 **Connect with Me**

I'm excited to be part of the GitHub community and the coding school, and I look forward to collaborating with fellow developers, sharing knowledge, and making a positive impact in the tech world. Let's connect and build amazing things together!
